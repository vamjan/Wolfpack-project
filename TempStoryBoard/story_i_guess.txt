Story I guess

Ep. 1 -  The run-away train

The MC is having a guard duty. Walking among the tents of temporal military base is used as basic tutorial for movement. Also can serve to show of our awesome graphics.
The MC overhears a couple of soldiers talking around fire about the war to offer player some super basic background. MC then continues their watch. A few tents over their encounter a friend of theirs who tells them about the treasure map and how to get it. The plan to steal it and run from army hatches. (This side of the conflict is stron on Slavic legends and legends of great treasures are wide spread. We can maybe add some background to the legends to meke them more set in stone). Next part of tutorial is EITHER

*** option 1 ***
MC distracts the captain who leaves his tent and goes to investigate. The friend then sneaks into the tent and steals the map. MC has to hide/run away from the captain. They then re-unite on the edge of the camp.

*** option 2 ***
Reverse roles. Friend distracts the captain so the MC has to crouch into the tent, steal and evaporate before the captain returns.
*** ***

When they get to the edge of the camp they encounter a guard looking out for soldiers who want to run away. Now they can EITHER

*** option 1 ***
THey try to sneak away, but the guard notices them. Luckyly it is their buddy and they invite him to join them. The three of them then run into the forest/ oner the hill (I think more desert-like enviroment would be cool. Somethin a little wild-west-y). There it turns out the buddy wants to kill MC, run away with the friend and keep the treasure to themselves. MC aims revolver at buddy, buddy at MC and friend at buddy. Argument begins and they argue. Friend starts yelling at buddy and provokes him to aim at him. Then friend yells at MC to shoot and MC kills the buddy. (this scene is here to tell the player the serious part of the game starts. Also it gives a little character to friedn. He is manipulative. He could kill the buddy at any time, but he made MC do it. This is not cleat "friend is evil!!" trigger, but if replayed players will notice this as important character moment).

*** option 2 ***
They leave the camp and ntohing happens. (potentional "now it is serious" moment follows in the village)
*** ***

When they feel they are far enough from the camp, they aim for near village.
