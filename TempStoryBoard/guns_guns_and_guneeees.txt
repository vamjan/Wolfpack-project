GUNS, Guns and guneeees

Revolver
Everybody has to have one. General issue, generic handle, genius gun.

Lumberjack's gun
Fires high velocity splinters. Highly flamable. Do not inhale.

The machine shooter
Once destroyed a train engine with one shot. Gained it's powers.

The crystal baller
A gypsy saw this gun's future and cursed it to be incredibly powerfull. The gypsy then left the country. Nobody knows what she saw.

The machete
A revolver made from an old machete. It cuts the bullets in half when they leave the barrel, so it deliveres twice the bullets per bullets.

The coffee miller
High speed bullets. Causes addiction. Is worth it.
